# Kutty Story

> A science outreach initiative through curated Kutty Stories!

We are a community focused on delivering science concepts, to the wider audience in an simple easy to comprehend format. In that direction we are building a blog with curated Kutty Stories and other forms of art sourced from the community, properly referenced.

## What is a Kutty Story?

A Kutty Story is essentially a short story. India has rich collection of stories owing to it's mixed culture.(We are not leaving out other countries. We respect and love their stories as well.) We are gifted by Panchatantra stories, Birbal stories, Tenali Raman stories and the much larger collections of folk tales to name a few. But we are defining it here in a more stringent manner, in order to utilise such easy to comprehend resources, to explain scientific concepts for common people.

### Requirements
